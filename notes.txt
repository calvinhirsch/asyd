In defaults, allow for config nesting inside queries. Right now, queries must be the most nested thing, but something like this could be allowed:
?field_a:
    >10:
        field_b: 5
        nested_config:
            field_c: 10

if you preprocess by copying the query and pasting it into the most nested possible location, like:
?field_a:
    >10:
        field_b: 5
nested_config:
    ?field_a:
        >10:
            field_c: 10
